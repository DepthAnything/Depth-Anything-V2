This work presents Depth Anything V2. It significantly outperforms [V1](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything) in fine-grained details and robustness. Compared with SD-based models, it enjoys faster inference speed, fewer parameters, and higher depth accuracy.

- **2024-06-22:** We release [smaller metric depth models](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2/tree/main/metric_depth#pre-trained-models) based on Depth-Anything-V2-Small and Base.
- **2024-06-20:** Our repository and project page are flagged by GitHub and removed from the public for 6 days. Sorry for the inconvenience.
- **2024-06-14:** Paper, project page, code, models, demo, and benchmark are all released.


## Pre-trained Models

We provide **four models** of varying scales for robust relative depth estimation:

| Model | Params | Checkpoint |
|:-|-:|:-:|
| Depth-Anything-V2-Small | 24.8M | [Download](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vits.pth?download=true) |
| Depth-Anything-V2-Base | 97.5M | [Download](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Base/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_vitb.pth?download=true) |

| Depth-Anything-V2-Giant | 1.3B | Coming soon |


## Usage

### Prepraration

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2
cd Depth-Anything-V2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the checkpoints listed [here](#pre-trained-models) and put them under the `checkpoints` directory.

### Use our models
```python
import cv2
import torch

from depth_anything_v2.dpt import DepthAnythingV2

DEVICE = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'mps' if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else 'cpu'

model_configs = {
    'vits': {'encoder': 'vits', 'features': 64, 'out_channels': [48, 96, 192, 384]},
    'vitb': {'encoder': 'vitb', 'features': 128, 'out_channels': [96, 192, 384, 768]},
    'vitl': {'encoder': 'vitl', 'features': 256, 'out_channels': [256, 512, 1024, 1024]},
    'vitg': {'encoder': 'vitg', 'features': 384, 'out_channels': [1536, 1536, 1536, 1536]}
}

encoder = 'vitl' # or 'vits', 'vitb', 'vitg'

model = DepthAnythingV2(**model_configs[encoder])
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(f'checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_{encoder}.pth', map_location='cpu'))
model = model.to(DEVICE).eval()

raw_img = cv2.imread('your/image/path')
depth = model.infer_image(raw_img) # HxW raw depth map in numpy
```

If you do not want to clone this repository, you can also load our models through [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/). Below is a simple code snippet. Please refer to the [official page](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/depth_anything_v2) for more details.

- Note 1: Make sure you can connect to Hugging Face and have installed the latest Transformers.
- Note 2: Due to the [upsampling difference](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/31522#issuecomment-2184123463) between OpenCV (we used) and Pillow (HF used), predictions may differ slightly. So you are more recommended to use our models through the way introduced above.
```python
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image

pipe = pipeline(task="depth-estimation", model="depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf")
image = Image.open('your/image/path')
depth = pipe(image)["depth"]
```

### Running script on *images*

```bash
python run.py \
  --encoder <vits | vitb | vitl | vitg> \
  --img-path <path> --outdir <outdir> \
  [--input-size <size>] [--pred-only] [--grayscale]
```
Options:
- `--img-path`: You can either 1) point it to an image directory storing all interested images, 2) point it to a single image, or 3) point it to a text file storing all image paths.
- `--input-size` (optional): By default, we use input size `518` for model inference. ***You can increase the size for even more fine-grained results.***
- `--pred-only` (optional): Only save the predicted depth map, without raw image.
- `--grayscale` (optional): Save the grayscale depth map, without applying color palette.

For example:
```bash
python run.py --encoder vitl --img-path assets/examples --outdir depth_vis
```

### Running script on *videos*

```bash
python run_video.py \
  --encoder <vits | vitb | vitl | vitg> \
  --video-path assets/examples_video --outdir video_depth_vis \
  [--input-size <size>] [--pred-only] [--grayscale]
```

***Our larger model has better temporal consistency on videos.***

### Gradio demo

To use our gradio demo locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

You can also try our [online demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Depth-Anything/Depth-Anything-V2).

***Note: Compared to V1, we have made a minor modification to the DINOv2-DPT architecture (originating from this [issue](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything/issues/81)).*** In V1, we *unintentionally* used features from the last four layers of DINOv2 for decoding. In V2, we use [intermediate features](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2/blob/2cbc36a8ce2cec41d38ee51153f112e87c8e42d8/depth_anything_v2/dpt.py#L164-L169) instead. Although this modification did not improve details or accuracy, we decided to follow this common practice.
